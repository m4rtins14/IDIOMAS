    "paragrafo1": "Do you know you are loved because you have been told so? Showing love requires more than kisses, sex and words. Feeling loved is feeling that someone has a real interest in your life. Who cares for your happiness, Who worries when things aren't working out. Who is ready to listen to your doubts, And who gives you a jolt when necessary.",
    "paragrafo2": "Being loved is seeing that he/she remembers things you told him two years ago. It's seeing how sad he/she is when you're sad,And how gently he smiles when he says you're making a big deal out of everything.",
    "paragrafo3": "He who does not see his hurt turned into ammunition at the time of an argument feels loved He who feels accepted, who feels whole, feels loved. The one who knows that everything can be said and understood.",
    "paragrafo4": "He feels loved who feels safe to be exactly as he is, Without inventing a character for the relationship, Well, no character lasts very long.",
    "paragrafo5": "He who does not pant, but sighs, feels loved; Who does not raise his voice, but speaks; Who doesn't agree, but listens. Now, sit down and listen: I love you doesn't say it all!"
